# Mino Material  
This is an opinionated Boilerplate with the following tecnologies:  
- ReactJS  
- Mobx  
- Firebase (for hosting too)   
- Material design  
- Typescript

### Demo  
[mino-material.firebaseapp.com](https://mino-material.firebaseapp.com/)

### Commands  
```npm install```  
Will install the dependencies and Typescript typings  

```npm run dev```  
Will compile the project and start the development server on localhost:3000  

```npm run build```  
Will create the production bundle, overriding the development one. Run this command before to deploy.

### Firebase CLI  
The project has been created using the Firebase CLI. You can use it to deploy to your Firebase instance.  
Change your project name ```.firebaserc``` file.

### Material design  
I have used React-Toolbox for Material Design components.  
If you want to keep the bundle as small as possible, pay attention how to write your import.

### Tests

### To do  
- Extract CSS in a separate Chunk  
- Progressive app configuration
